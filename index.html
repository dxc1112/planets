<h1> QC Samples​​
​​​​Check missing phenotypes
Remove individuals /samples with missing phenotype PLINK --prune

Check call rates by sample
Remove individuals that do not meet the call rate threshold/low genotyping
(Call rate < 98%; MIND > 0.02; may use 95% depending on data ). PLINK --mind 0.02

Check that sex matches as expected
Run sex check to make sure sex in correctly identified based on heterozygosity rates. Remove or change individuals with incorrect or questionable sex info. PLINK --check-sex [ycount] 

Check for duplicated samples
Check for duplicate samples PLINK --genome

Check relationships
Remove people with incorrect relationships PLINK --genome rel-check

Run concordance analyses with available GWAS and/or sequencing data PLINK --merge-mode 7 / --gehome
 
 QC SNPs
Check Call rates by SNP
Remove SNPs with call rate less than 95%; the SNPS that failed missingness test (GENO > 0.05). (May need to use 98% threshold, depending on data)  PLINK --geno 0.06

Check MAF
Remove monomorphic SNPs PLINK --maf 0​.0001 --nonfounders

Remove duplicate SNPs
Remove duplicate SNPs; some locations have 2 or 3 different SNPs listed. This may be done by selecting the SNP with the lowest missing value rate after concordance checks verify that the SNPs have duplicate calls.  PLINK --list-duplicate-vars

Verify all duplicate or multi-allelic SNPs are gone by looking at chrom and bp only

Check HWE
Remove SNPS (if indicated by study) that have MAF > 0.05 that fail the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test at a specified significant threshold; HWE test ( p <= .000001 )       PLINK --hwe

         Or.... flag SNPs and decide which ones to drop based on cluster plots. ​


If indicated Check for differential missingness

Remove markers which show differential missingness rates (above a given threshold) between cases and controls.

       o First flag SNPs above the threshold
       o Run single-SNP analyses with the SNPs in and then look at results to decide what SNPs need to be removed   PLINK --test-missing</h1>
